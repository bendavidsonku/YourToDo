                <h2>About YourToDo</h2><br>
                <p>Students at every level of education benefit from utilizing a more organized and streamlined workflow when it comes to day-to-day and weekly activities. While there exist many productivity tools across the software spectrum in todayâ€™s world, there are no tools that allow the categorization of tasks that can be grouped together and viewed in a more efficient manner.</p><br>

                <p>This problem can be solved with an application that allows students to create and manage their own planners specific to their class schedule, which is what we've made possible with our categorical based planner.</p><br>

                <p>YourToDo is the brainchild of Ben Davidson, who had been using a custom made table in a note keeping app to track his classes throughout the week. After proposing the idea to the team for our group project, we all decided it was worth the time and effort, and after a few long months, are pleased to present the final product. We hope you enjoy it!</p><br>
